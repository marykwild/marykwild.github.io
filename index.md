For my final, group project at the University of Missouri's data science master's degree program, I worked with millions of rows of data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, making use of data points newly released in 2018 to evaluate whether the lending market is fair to non-white borrowers, even when controlling for an individual's financial status.

As a health reporter for the newspaper in Charleston, South Carolina, when COVID-19 broke out, I had to learn to work quickly to inform readers by finding data sources I had never used before. For this analysis, I used complicated files hospitals have to submit to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services every year to determine where intensive care beds existed in the state â€” something we couldn't easily determine through our traditional reporting methods. Later, I used the same data to look at two rural hospitals that had been experiencing low occupancy since a 2015 flood. COVID-19 only made it worse.
